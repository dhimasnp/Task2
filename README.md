Description
This API application is designed for the Good Reading Bookstore, with its codebase organized into different files based on functionality. The business logic of the API resides in controller.js, while database queries for PostgreSQL are handled in queries.js. The routes.js file defines the endpoint routes, and db.js maintains the Pool connection to the PostgreSQL database, using credentials stored in the .env file. The entry point for the backend is server.js
